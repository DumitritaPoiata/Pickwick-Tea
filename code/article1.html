            What is Character Animation
        </h1>
        <p>
            According to Wikipedia, Character Animation is a specialized area of the animation process, which requires bringing animated 
            characters to life. Character animators breathe life into their characters, creating the illusion of thought, emotion, and personality.
            Character animation is generally defined as the art of making a particular character move in a two- or three-dimensional background. 
            The idea has evolved through various types of animation techniques.
            Many associate the early character animation with Walt Disney Studios, where cartoon-artists built characters and presented them 
            with specific traits and aspects on screen. This required combining a lot of technical drawing and animation with some high-level ideas about 
            how the character might move, think, or behave.

        <p>
            As primitive cartoon animation gave way to modern three-dimensional animation, character animation has evolved along with it.
            Today’s character animation involves elements like character rigging and the creation of object-oriented frameworks for creating
            character sequences. At the same time, processes like voice dubbing by celebrities and advanced character profiles are doing the 
            conceptual work of building that character’s persona and background. One example is the early CGI Toy Story movies, where the careful
            creation of specialized on-screen characters has sold lots of merchandise and driven the films to legacy blockbuster status.
        </p>
        <p>
            Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur (1914) is often considered the first example of true character animation. Later, Otto Messmer
             imbued Felix the Cat with an instantly recognizable personality during the 1920s.
            In the 1930s, Walt Disney made character animation a particular focus of his animation studio, best showcased in productions suc
            h as Three Little Pigs (1933), Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940), and Dumbo (1941). Snow White and the Se
            ven Dwarfs was the "first full length animated and musical feature" in Technicolor. Disney animators such as Disney’s Nine Old Me
            n and others all became masters of the technique.

        <p>
            Disney's Nine Old Men were Walt Disney Productions' core animators, some of whom later became directors, who created some of Disney's 
            most famous animated cartoons and were referred to as such by Walt Disney himself. Two of those animators, Frank and Ollie taught that
            the thoughts and emotions behind the character were primary to the creation of every scene. Out of all the Nine Old Men, Frank and Ollie
            were the most known for their mentor/apprentice relationships, and the sharing of their knowledge about creating characters, most notably 
            as transcribed through Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life. This book relays the 12 basic principles of animation, and is informally 
            considered to be the 'animation bible' for any student of animation.

            Though typical examples of character animation are found in animated feature films, the role of character animation within the 
            gaming industry is rapidly increasing. Game developers are using more complicated characters that allow the gamer to connect with
            the gaming experience more fully. Prince of Persia, God of War, Team Fortress II or Resident Evil contain examples of character 
            animation in games.
        </p>
        <p>Character animation is often contrasted with creature animation, in which specialised animators bring to life realistic animals and creatures, 
            such as dinosaurs and fantasy creatures. Visual effects animators specialise in animating vehicles, machinery, and natural phenomena such as rain,
            snow, lightning and water, as well as the "non-natural" effects often seen in science fiction films. There is a good deal of overlap between these 
            areas. Sometimes, visual effects animators will use the same principles of character animation; an early example is the pseudopod in The Abyss.
            On-going computer science research on character animation deals with the question of generating multi-layer level of detail at run-time to allow large 
            crowd rendering in real-time applications. Realistic character movements are often simulated using motion capture and soft-body dynamics simulations.
